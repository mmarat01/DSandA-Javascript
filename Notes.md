# Notes

- **Unshift** adds to the beginning of an array.
- **Shift** removes from the beinning of an array.

- **Push** adds to the end of an array.
- **Pop** adds from the end of an array.

---

- Queues as linked lists are more performant than as arrays because unshift/shift is not as perfromant as node insertions/deletions.
